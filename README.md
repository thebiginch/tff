# TFF (Tinder for Fighting)

TFF is a hackathon project to build a Tinder clone obstensibly for the purpose of arranging fights between users.  

## Description
Users are able to log in and find matches using a Tinder-inspired swiping interface.  An algorithm ensures a user's potential matches are optimized based on the decisions of other users to "swipe left" or "swipe right".  When users find a match, they are alerted and can view all of their matches in a seperate tab.

The frontend is an Android app built using Angular and the Ionic framework. User data is provided by a backend server built using Node.js, Express, and SQL.
